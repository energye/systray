# Systray

systray is a cross-platform Go library to place an icon and menu in the notification area.
This repository is a fork of [getlantern/systray](https://github.com/getlantern/systray)
removing the GTK dependency and support for legacy linux system tray.

## Features

* Supported on Windows, macOS, Linux and many BSD systems
* Menu items can be checked and/or disabled
* Methods may be called from any Goroutine
* tray icon supports mouse click, double click, and right click

## API

```go
package main

import "github.com/energye/systray"
import "github.com/energye/systray/icon"

func main() {
	systray.Run(onReady, onExit)
}

func onReady() {
	systray.SetIcon(icon.Data)
	systray.SetTitle("Awesome App")
	systray.SetTooltip("Pretty awesome超级棒")
	systray.SetOnClick(func(menu systray.IMenu) {
		fmt.Println("SetOnClick")
	})
	systray.SetOnDClick(func(menu systray.IMenu) {
		fmt.Println("SetOnDClick")
	})
	systray.SetOnRClick(func(menu systray.IMenu) {
		menu.ShowMenu()
		fmt.Println("SetOnRClick")
	})
	mQuit := systray.AddMenuItem("Quit", "Quit the whole app")

	// Sets the icon of a menu item.
	mQuit.SetIcon(icon.Data)
}

func onExit() {
	// clean up here
}
```

### Run in another toolkit

Most graphical toolkits will grab the main loop so the `Run` code above is not possible.
For this reason there is another entry point `RunWithExternalLoop`.
This function of the library returns a start and end function that should be called
when the application has started and will end, to loop in appropriate features.

Note: this package requires cgo, so make sure you set `CGO_ENABLED=1` before building.

## Try the example app!

Have go v1.12+ or higher installed? Here's an example to get started on macOS or Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/energye/systray
cd systray/example
go run .
```

On Windows, you should follow the instructions above, but use the followign run command:

```
go run -ldflags "-H=windowsgui" .
```

Now look for *Awesome App* in your menu bar!

## Platform notes

### Linux/BSD

This implementation uses DBus to communicate through the SystemNotifier/AppIndicator spec, older tray implementations may not load the icon.

If you are running an older desktop environment, or system tray provider, you may require a proxy app which can convert the new DBus calls to the old format.
The recommended tool for Gnome based trays is [snixembed](https://git.sr.ht/~steef/snixembed), others are available.
Search for "StatusNotifierItems XEmbedded" in your package manager.

### Windows

```sh
go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui
```

### macOS

On macOS, you will need to create an application bundle to wrap the binary; simply use add folders with the following minimal structure and assets:

```
SystrayApp.app/
  Contents/
    Info.plist
    MacOS/
      go-executable
    Resources/
      SystrayApp.icns
```

If bundling manually, you may want to add one or both of the following to your Info.plist:

```xml
	<!-- avoid having a blurry icon and text -->
	<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
	<string>True</string>

	<!-- avoid showing the app on the Dock -->
	<key>LSUIElement</key>
	<string>1</string>
```
